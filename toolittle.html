			<p class="p1"> <span class="marker">Budget Problems</span> <br> Budgeting is a large concern for smaller, less-visited parks as well. In order to keep them alive and thriving, they require funding from those gracious enough to offer it either by donation or by merely visiting the parks alone. But, because there aren’t as many individuals who seek out these parks, there isn’t as much money being gained, causing a decrease in upkeep, not to mention upgrade, which would entice more individuals to visit.
			<br>
			<br>The remote location of many of these smaller parks is, very possibly, the biggest cause for decrease in visitation, which is, unfortunately, something that can’t be changed. Although, the isolated feel that they offer, can also be an appealing factor to some National Park lovers if only they were aware of their existence.</p>
			<p class="p2"> <span class="marker">Inability to Spread Awareness</span> <br> Having a lack of attraction at smaller National Parks makes it almost impossible to spread awareness regarding their small following and low funding. Unfortunately, there is not much that can be done about this except to make yourself aware and to spread awareness yourself.
			<br>
			<br>One of the most important things a fellow National Park lover like you can do is to spread awareness. Whether it be through social media or conversationally, any amount of awareness to bring to light the issues our parks are facing, can be extremely impactful. Informing friends, family, neighbors, classmates, or strangers about these issues and how they can help may only be just the first step in helping these parks thrive, but it is, by far, the most important. This Earth needs an advocate to speak the truth we may not want to face, and that could be you.</p>
