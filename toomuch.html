			<p class="p1"> <span class="marker">Budget Problems</span> <br> Because of the overwhelming amount of visitors the National Parks around our country receive each year, there is a substantial amount of debt that they face in order to keep everything maintained and just as beautiful for the next visitors. According to National Geographic, there is a $9.5 billion maintenance backlog that the National Park Service (NPS) is waiting on to upkeep the parks. Not to mention, “there’s been a 90% increase in vehicle accidents, a 60% bump in calls for ambulance services and a 130% rise in searches and rescues, according to the park. And while visitation has swelled, staffing, because of budget limitations, has remained the same,” according to The Guardian.</p>
			<p class="p2"> <span class="marker">Waste Management</span> <br> It is extremely important to leave everything how you found it. With the amount of individuals that visit the National Parks every day, it can seem almost impossible to keep the parks clean and enjoyable for not only the visitors but also the creatures that live there. Leaving trash and other foreign objects lying around the parks can be very dangerous the various residents of the parks. 
			<br>
			<br>Being conscious of where you toss your trash can be much more helpful than you may know.</p>
			<p class="p3"> <span class="marker">Traffic</span> <br> According to The Guardian, in May 2018, “a Phoenix man fell to his death when he slipped off the cliff edge. In 2010, a Greek tourist died when a rock underneath him gave way, police said, as he took photos.” As tragic as they are, accidents like these two happen more often than we’d like to admit, and they could have been prevented if only these parks weren’t so overpopulated. Dan Wenk, Yellowstone’s former superintendent, stated that “The least-studied mammal in Yellowstone is the most abundant: humans.”
			<br>
			<br>It is frustrating to hear that it is our own species creating such a negative impact on the overall experience of visiting our country’s National Parks. “Traffic congestion has become one of the most visible consequences of overcrowding and underfunding, with some locations seeing tens of thousands of cars a day during peak months,” Says The Guardian. In the summer, the peak park visitation months, some expect “two - to three - hour delays" while entering the parks.</p>
			<p class="p4"> <span class="marker">Wildlife Management</span> <br> Most parks have no set boundaries to keep any unwanted creatures inside or to protect any cherished creatures, that live within, from being harmed. These creatures must often leave the boundaries in order to mate, feed or even migrate, and because they don’t have the ability to fully understand the park's boundaries they are susceptible to any dangers lying outside the borders such as mining, logging, farming, and more.</p>
			<p class="p5">These creatures are also becoming more and more comfortable with the large amounts of visitors coming and going daily, causing a rewilding. This newfound familiarity between animals and humans can cause traffic jams and even casualties on both ends. Travelers become excited when they are in the presence of a wild animal and will, oftentimes, do anything to get a good photo, but this can be very dangerous. Even though these animals are becoming more brave with their distance with you, your reciprocation can still frighten them and cause an act of rage to strike. Respecting the wild from a distance is always the best option whilst visiting National Parks.</p>
