			<p class="text"> National Parks are now some of the only places in the U.S. in which allow a place of sanctuary for the plants and creatures that live within them. According to The Guardian in an article titled, “Crisis in our national parks: how tourists are loving nature to death,” “Once parks were the ultimate place to disconnect from the modern world. But today visitors have fresh expectations – and in accommodating these new demands, some say parks are unwittingly driving the very behavior that’s spoiling them.”
			<br>
			<br> Because of this, we must face the truth that we, as a human race, are doing no favors for these naturally sacred places. Having too much attraction to some of these parks can cause a lot of problems such as waste and wildlife management. But, not enough attraction to some of the smaller parks can also cause problems in order to keep them afloat. It is important to be aware of these issues as well as what you can do to help.</p>
